    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious sauteed kale recipe that I got from my mom and tweaked a bit. It tastes so good that even my 18-month-old son will eat it! Serve with extra olive oil and salt, if desired. We enjoy this recipe with plenty of salt and oil. I do not measure exactly. It's a recipe you can play around with!</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds white potatoes, cubed/li>
        <li>Â½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 bunch kale, stemmed and torn into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
       
   </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender but still holding their shape, about 15 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until quite hot. Toss in pieces of kale; reduce heat to medium. Cover and cook, stirring often, until kale begins to soften and crisp slightly, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic.</li>
        <li>Add remaining olive oil when onions are beginning to brown. Stir in potatoes and season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until potatoes are completely softened, about 5 minutes. Remove lid; cook and stir until potatoes just begin to brown, about 10 minutes more.</li>
       
    </ol>
