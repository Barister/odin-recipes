    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Briam is a traditional Greek roasted vegetable dish with potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, and red onions with lots of olive oil. It is a typical example of Greek cuisine where a few simple ingredients are turned into an utterly delicious dish with little effort. With olive oil as the only source of fat, it is a quintessential example of the Mediterranean diet — and it's vegan to boot. Briam can be served as a main course with a hearty chunk of feta on the side.</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 large zucchini, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 small red onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 ripe tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
       
   </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread potatoes, zucchini, and red onions in an extra-large baking dish (9x13-inch or larger, or use 2 baking dishes if necessary). Cover with pureed tomatoes, olive oil, and parsley; season liberally with salt and pepper. Toss all ingredients together so that vegetables are evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Stir, then continue to bake until vegetables are tender and the moisture has evaporated, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool slightly before serving, or serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
